## Description

For this project, we were tasked with creating a simple webpage to familiarize ourselves with HTML, CSS, and JS before starting classes on 11/14/2022. During the course of this assignment, I started to solve the fundimental problem this entire program will seek to address, which is my lack of understanding of how to code. I learned new things, specifially JS and CSS style sheet creation.
